# IncluDO_app
Hello! What you are about to see is my (first version of an) app created for a fictional (but realistic) training agency called IncluDO. The aim of this app is to manage the interactions among all the entities involved in the training agency (the people enrolled in the courses, the corses themselves and the companies that collaborate with IncluDO).
I wrote this app using TypeScript only. 

PLEASE NOTE that the app and all its comments are in Italian.

To see the app you can:
1. download the source code, run it in your IDE of choice and compile the TypeScript files into JavaScripts, then open the "index.html" file in your browser - you'll see how the code works from the console in your web browser ("Inspect" on Google Chrome, "Analize" on Firefox etc.)
   -> since you've arrived here, I assume you know very well how transpiling TypeScript files into JavaScript works, but just in case you didn't know here's a quick guide on how to compile this code:
   a. download the source code and open it in your IDE;
   b. inside the project folder, open your preferred terminal (like Command Prompt or Git Bash);
   c. from the terminal, move to the "ts" folder inside the "assets" one (type "cd assets" and then "cd ts" in the command line, if you want to do it the long way);
   d. compile the project typing "tsc" in the command line (do it while you're inside the "ts" folder): you will see that a new folder called "dist" has appeared - that's the folder where all the transpiled JavaSctipt files are;
   e. now that the project is ready, you can open the "index.html" file in your preferred browser and see how the code works from the browser console.

2. go to the Codepen page of the project and see it compiling live on the console: https://codepen.io/carlaisabelle/pen/WbrbWZz ;

3. if you are only intreseted in seeing what the code can do, but you don't want to see the source code, you can go to this website and see it in the console of your browser: https://rococo-puppy-06d138.netlify.app/ .

I hope you'll enjoy my work! If you have any enquiries, feel free shoot me a DM!
